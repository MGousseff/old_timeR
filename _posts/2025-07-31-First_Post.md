How humbling it is to learn a new way to blog at almost fifty! I feel so lucky to have landed a position where learning is compulsory. 
Don't get me wrong, I hate to see each day how poor are my coder's skills, but I love to see I can improve a little each time. 

# Main interests of this blogs

The subject I expect to deal with are mainly : 
1. How to write a better R code
  + using fast and reliable packages
  + writing reproducible pipelines
  + packaging code in a proper way
2. Best statistical methods to analyze a given dataset
  + what hypothesis do I make on my data?
  + what do I want to highlight?
  + what models can I use?
  + which package implement them the best?
3. Other language can I explore
  + is leanring Python necessary?
  + how much of groovy or java do I need to know to work with my colleagues who use them?
  + is SQL really better than R syntax to wrangle data, and if so, how to interface R and proper data-bases?
4. Other scientific fields from which my data come
  + Geography and Geographical Information Systems
  + Urban Climate and climate change
  + Climate related social, health and environmental issues

# Frequency of publication
I will post whenever I want and can, but I mainly wanted a second item to check if markdown syntax was OK !
