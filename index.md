I am currently following the steps of a tutorial on how to use gitHub pages to write a blog. 

# Introduction
Why would you start a blog when you are 50 years old and one of the worst programmer you know ? I would because I reckon how ever old I may be, I'll do all the rookie mistakes, or, worse, all the bad practices one develops when they don't learn how to code but just wish to process and analyze data. I hope that my journey towards getting rid of these mistakes may help others to avoid them. 
If not, it still maybe a propoer personal knowledge base.
